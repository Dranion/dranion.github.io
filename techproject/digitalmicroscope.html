<h1 class="artheader"> Digital Microscopy </h1>
<p>Microscopes are almost a main staple in any form and level of science. While there are many types, an electron microscope is highly effective for a citizen scientist, as it has the necessary magnification for most experiments while being easy to use and record data with.  It seems almost impossible that technology exists that allows such clear imaging of things as tiny as a single cell. While there are a variety of microscopes available, ranging from optical to electron, the majority on the lower-price range are digital. Digital microscopes are ideal for citizen scientists, as they require little training to effectively use (Schlaffer & DeRose, 2015). Lower-priced digital microscopes typically go up to around 250x, and are essentially high-quality digital cameras. To understand if a digital microscope is what you want, you should first understand how they, and thus digital cameras, work.
</p> <h3>How do Digital Cameras Work? </h3>

  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">(Small, 2017)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> Digital cameras focus light through a system of lenses. Included in these lenses is the diaphram, which can be modified to change the amount of light allowed through, along with an assorted number of different focuses. In digital cameras used for photography, adjusting these lenses is what determines the amount of light allowed through, and what the camera focuses on. In many digital microscopes, the same mechanisms are used, though they sometimes look different to the outside user. Once the shutter is opened so that an image can be taken, the light goes directly to a digital sensor in the back of the camera.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">(Hess, 2012)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This digital sensors consist of millions of tiny photosites, which store photons in a cavity. These photosites are closed once the camera finishes taking the picture. The number of photons, along with their intensity levels, determine the color sent to the RAM card. Each sensor returns a number of electrons, or an electrical current, which varies with the intensity of the light. These electrical signals are sent through wires to be stored just like any other computer file would.

<h3>How Do Digital Microscopes Get Their Magnification? </h3>
<p>Normal digital cameras do not capture details at magnifications such as 250x. Digital microscopes have a modified lens similar to the Macro lens used in close-up photography. They rely on a fundamental principle of light based physics, in that the further the lens is from the sensor, the better the focusing distance and magnification are.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">(Panasonic, n.d.)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is a cheat for this though - rather than extending the distance, digital microscopes and cameras can also use many different lens to create a similar effect, allowing the detailed focus of the digital microscopes.
Digital microscopes function through a clever combination of lens techniques and digital photography technology. There are limits to the magnification that these microscopes can reach, as the photoreceptors have physical limitations that can not be fully surpasses. Despite this, the comparative simplicity of the lens system to the complex systems of both optical and electron microscopes makes digital microscopes an attractive option both for budgeting and for ease of use.
